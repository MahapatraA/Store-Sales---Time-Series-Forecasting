# Store-Sales---Time-Series-Forecasting
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to uncover seasonality, trends, and anomalies in sales patterns.
Engineered features such as lag variables, date attributes, and categorical encodings improve model accuracy
Developed forecasting models using Decision Tree and Neural Networks to predict store sales from historical time-series data
Evaluated model performance with RMSLE, identifying LightGBM as the best-performing algorithm for large datasets
